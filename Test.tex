\section{Minimal Action and Field Equations}

\subsection{Postulates and notation (metric signature, units)}

We begin by fixing the conventions that remain in force throughout the paper. Spacetime is the smooth manifold $R^{\mathbb{1},\mathbb{3}}$ endowed, at the level of the fundamental action, with the inertial metric $\eta_{\mu \nu }=\mathrm{diag}\left(-1,+1,+1,+1\right)$. Greek indices $\mu ,\nu ,\mathrm{\dots }$ run over the coordinate labels $0,1,2,3$ and are raised or lowered with ${\eta }_{\mu \nu }$ unless otherwise specified; Latin indices $i,j,\mathrm{\dots }$ refer to spatial components $1,2,3$. The Einstein summation convention is implicit, and commas denote partial differentiation, so that ${\Phi}_{,\mu }\equiv {\partial }_{\mu }\Phi$.

Natural units are adopted: the reduced Planck constant $\hslash $ and the speed of light $c$ are set to unity, $\mathrm{\hslash }=c=1$. Length, time and mass therefore share the common dimension of inverse energy. We keep Newton's constant $G_{\mathrm{N}}$ explicit, but in most intermediate expressions it is convenient to trade it for the Planck mass $M_{\mathrm{Pl}}$ via $M^2_{\mathrm{Pl}}=1/\left(8\pi G_{\mathrm{N}}\right)$.

The basic dynamical variable is a real scalar field $\Phi\left(x\right)$ with canonical mass dimension one. Its self-interaction potential $V\left(\Phi\right)$ is assumed to admit at least one non-degenerate vacuum value ${\Phi}_{\infty}$ around which $V''\left({\Phi}_{\infty}\right)>0$. A single positive constant $\alpha $ of dimension ${\left[\mathrm{Energy}\right]}^{-4}$ sets the strength of the derivative coupling that will generate the effective metric introduced in \S 3.

All tensor equations quoted in the sequel obey the $\left(-\ +++\right)$ signature and the $+++$ sign convention for the Riemann tensor,  $R^{\rho }_{\sigma \mu \nu }={\partial }_{\mu }{\Gamma}^{\rho }_{\nu \sigma }-{\partial }_{\nu }{\Gamma}^{\rho }_{\mu \sigma }+{\Gamma}^{\rho }_{\mu \lambda }{\Gamma}^{\lambda }_{\nu \sigma }-{\Gamma}^{\rho }_{\nu \lambda }{\Gamma}^{\lambda }_{\mu \sigma }$. Covariant derivatives with respect to ${\eta }_{\mu \nu }$ coincide with partial derivatives, while those taken with respect to the emergent disformal metric $g^{\mathrm{eff}}_{\mu \nu }$ are written ${\mathrm{\nabla }}_{\mu }$.

With these postulates and notational choices established, we now turn to the construction of the minimal Lorentz-invariant action for $\Phi$ and the derivation of its Euler--Lagrange and stress--energy equations.


\subsection{Lorentz-invariant prototype action}

Guided solely by locality, Poincar\'{e} symmetry and the postulates set out in {\S} 2.A, we take the fundamental dynamics of the proto-field to be governed by the canonical Klein--Gordon Lagrangian supplemented by a self-interaction potential, guided solely by locality and Lorentz invariance, we take the prototype action to be
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.1}
\mathcal{S}\left[\Phi\right]\ =\ \int{d^4}x\ \left[-\frac{1}{2}\ {\partial }_{\mu }\Phi\ {\partial }^{\mu }\Phi\ -\ V\left(\Phi\right)\right].
\end{equation}
where the overall minus sign guarantees a positive kinetic energy in the Hamiltonian density.

The kinetic coefficient 1/2 ensures a canonically normalized propagator in the free-field limit, while Lorentz invariance follows from the contraction of gradients with $\eta^{\mu\nu}$. The potential $V(\Phi)$ is left generic at this stage, subject only to the existence of at least one non-degenerate vacuum $\Phi_{\infty}$ with $V''(\Phi_{\infty}){>}0$ so that small perturbations have positive mass squared. Any overall constant in $V$ is physically irrelevant in flat space and will drop out of the stress--energy tensor derived below.

Action \eqref{eq2.1} contains no higher than first derivatives and is therefore free of Ostrogradsky instabilities. Nevertheless, once the field gradients are promoted to geometric data in {\S} 3, the same expression will generate an effective metric and an associated quartic gradient energy that stabilises localised configurations against Derrick's scaling argument. Thus \eqref{eq2.1} represents the \textit{minimal} Lorentz-invariant starting point from which all subsequent constructions of the Proto Field Gravity Model unfold.


\subsection{Euler--Lagrange equation}

Varying the action (\ref{eq2.1}*) with respect to the field while imposing vanishing surface terms, we obtain $\delta\mathcal S =\int d^{4}x \bigl[-\partial_\mu\Phi\,\partial^{\mu}\delta\Phi -V'(\Phi)\,\delta\Phi\bigr] =\int d^{4}x\, \bigl[\partial_\mu\partial^{\mu}\Phi -V'(\Phi)\bigr]\delta\Phi$.

Requiring $\delta S=0 $ for arbitrary $\delta\Phi$ yields the field equation

\begin{equation}\label{eq2}
\partial_\mu\partial^{\mu}\Phi\;-\;V'(\Phi)=0,
\end{equation}
or, in more familiar notation, $\Box\Phi-V'(\Phi)=0$ with $\Box\equiv -\partial_{t}^{2}+\nabla^{2}$ under our $(-+\!+\!+)$ signature. Linearising around a vacuum $\Phi=\Phi_{\infty}+\varphi$ gives $(\Box-m^{2})\varphi=0$ with $m^{2}=V''(\Phi_{\infty})>0$, confirming that small excitations propagate as Klein--Gordon waves of positive mass squared.


\subsection{Stress--energy tensor in flat spacetime}

To compute the conserved stress--energy tensor we follow the standard Hilbert prescription, varying the action with respect to the background metric and then reinstating $\eta_{\mu\nu}$:
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.3}
T_{\mu\nu} =-\frac{2}{\sqrt{-\eta}}\, \frac{\delta\mathcal S}{\delta\eta^{\mu\nu}} =\partial_\mu\Phi\,\partial_\nu\Phi +\eta_{\mu\nu} \bigl[-\frac{1}{2}\,\partial_\rho\Phi\,\partial^{\rho}\Phi -V(\Phi)\bigr].
\end{equation}

Equation~\eqref{eq2.3} is symmetric, gauge-independent and conserved on-shell: $\partial^{\mu}T_{\mu\nu}=0$ once \eqref{eq2} holds. In particular, the energy density reads
\begin{equation}\label{eq2.4}
  T_{00} =\tfrac12(\partial_{t}\Phi)^{2} +\tfrac12|\nabla\Phi|^{2} +V(\Phi),
\end{equation}
which is manifestly positive for any real configuration, consistent with (\ref{eq2.1}*) and with the stability requirements laid out in Appendix B.


\begin{enumerate}
\item  \textbf{Surface term in the variation} Explicitly showing the integration by parts highlights the minus--minus cancellation:

$$-\!\int\!\partial_\mu\Phi\,\partial^\mu\delta\Phi = -\!\int\!\partial_\mu\!\bigl(\Phi{,\mu}\delta\Phi\bigr) +\!\int\!(\Box\Phi)\,\delta\Phi.$$


The boundary term vanishes for fields that decay sufficiently fast.
\item  \textbf{Trace of $\boldsymbol{T_{\mu\nu}}$} With your conventions $T^\mu_\mu = -(\partial\Phi)^2 - 4V(\Phi)$ which is useful later when you discuss scale (conformal) properties.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Emergent Disformal Metric}

\subsection{Gradient-defined metric}

The canonical stress--energy tensor \eqref{eq2.3} is quadratic in field gradients, suggesting that a suitable contraction of $\partial_\mu\Phi$ with itself can be re-interpreted as a deformation of the background geometry. Following the algebra of Appendix B, we promote the Minkowski metric to the \textbf{effective, disformal metric}

\begin{equation} \label{eq3.1}
g^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu} \;=\;\eta_{\mu\nu} +\alpha\,\partial_\mu\Phi\,\partial_\nu\Phi,
\end{equation}
where $\alpha>0 $ carries mass dimension $-4$. The ansatz is rank-one in the sense of Sherman--Morrison and therefore admits closed-form expressions for its inverse and determinant,
\begin{equation}\label{eq3.2}
  g_{\rm eff}^{\mu\nu} =\eta^{\mu\nu} -\frac{\alpha\,\partial^{\mu}\Phi\,\partial^{\nu}\Phi}{1+\alpha X}, \qquad \sqrt{-g_{\rm eff}} =(1+\alpha X)^{1/2},
\end{equation}
with $X=\eta^{\rho\sigma}\partial_\rho\Phi\,\partial_\sigma\Phi$. Provided $1+\alpha X>0$, $g^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}$ is Lorentzian and smoothly reduces to $\eta_{\mu\nu}$ when gradients vanish. The field thus furnishes its own rods and clocks: world-lines of point probes extremise the line element $ds^{2}=g^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}dx^{\mu}dx^{\nu}$, and measurements made with such probes automatically register the back-reaction of matter on spacetime.

With our $(-+++)$ metric $X=-\dot\Phi^{2}+|\nabla\Phi|^{2}$; thus $1+\alpha X>0$ is automatically satisfied for static or mildly timelike gradients when $\alpha$ is chosen below the Planck scale.

In the weak-gradient regime $\alpha X\ll1 $ the metric perturbation is small, $g^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}\simeq \eta_{\mu\nu}+\alpha\,\partial_\mu\Phi\,\partial_\nu\Phi$, and the inverse series $g^{\rm eff}_{\mu\nu}\simeq\eta^{\mu\nu}-\alpha\,\partial^{\mu}\Phi\,\partial^{\nu}\Phi+\mathcal O(\alpha^{2}X^{2})$ confirms that the propagation of low-amplitude waves is only mildly disformal. Conversely, near steep gradients the deformation grows, supplying the quartic-gradient pressure that balances Derrick scaling and anchors localised solitons ({\S} 5). No higher than first derivatives enter (3.1); the equations of motion therefore remain second order and free of Ostrogradsky ghosts despite the presence of an emergent geometry.

\subsection{Relation to Horndeski and ``mimetic'' constructions}

Disformal metrics of the type (3.1) belong to the wider class introduced by Bekenstein, $g_{\mu\nu}=A(\Phi,X)\tilde g_{\mu\nu}+B(\Phi,X)\partial_\mu\Phi\partial_\nu\Phi$, whose most general second-order dynamics are encoded in Horndeski's theory and its degenerate extensions. Horndeski models, however, treat $g_{\mu\nu}$ and $\Phi$ as independent variables and assemble the action from a menu of curvature tensors, while in Proto Field Gravity the metric \textit{emerges algebraically} from $\Phi$ itself. The resulting Lagrangian after the field redefinition contains only the Klein--Gordon term plus an algebraic potential (Appendix B, eqs.~(B16)--(B17)), whereas generic Horndeski lagrangians feature explicit second derivatives of $\Phi$.

Closer in spirit is ``mimetic'' gravity, where one imposes the constraint $g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\,\partial_\nu\phi=-1$ via a Lagrange multiplier and identifies the physical metric as a singular disformal transform of an auxiliary metric. That framework yields an extra, pressure-less degree of freedom often interpreted as dark matter. PFGM differs in two key respects: (i) the metric deformation is non-singular $(1+\alpha)$, so no extra constraint or multiplier is necessary; (ii) the same scalar simultaneously generates geometry \textit{and} supplies stress--energy through the quartic term, avoiding an additional dust component. In short, PFGM realises the disformal idea in its most economical form: a one-field ontology whose gradients endow spacetime with curvature while maintaining second-order field equations and a positive-definite energy.
